Title: Lost Driver’s Licence – What to Do
If you have lost your driver’s licence, you should immediately file an FIR (First Information Report) at your nearest police station. After that, apply for a duplicate licence online through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ Sarathi portal (https://parivahan.gov.in/sarathiservice). You will need a copy of the FIR, proof of identity, and passport-size photographs. The application is processed by your Regional Transport Office (RTO).

Title: Lost Aadhaar Card or Other ID Proof
If you lose your Aadhaar card, you do not need to reapply. You can download an electronic copy (e-Aadhaar) anytime from the UIDAI website (https://myaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/) using your Aadhaar number or enrolment ID. For other ID cards such as PAN, you can request a reprint from NSDL/UTIITSL portals. Always keep a police complaint copy if the document was lost to prevent misuse.

Title: Land Disputes – Where to File
Land and property disputes are civil matters and can be filed in the appropriate civil court within whose jurisdiction the property is located. For disputes involving tenancy, inheritance, or illegal possession, consult a civil lawyer. For faster resolution, you may also approach Lok Adalats or Mediation Centres established under the Legal Services Authorities Act. More details: https://doj.gov.in/legal-aid

Citizens who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to free legal aid under Article 39A of the Constitution. The Legal Services Authorities (NALSA and State Legal Services Authorities) provide advocates free of cost for cases related to women, children, SC/ST communities, and weaker sections. To apply, visit your nearest District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) or apply online: https://nalsa.gov.in/

Title: Family Disputes and Mediation
For issues like domestic disputes, maintenance, custody, or divorce, citizens can approach the Family Court in their district.
